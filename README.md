**If you can afford it, please support good journalism.**

I'm really impressed by how fast some journalists catch up with the latest trend on China's social media. I often get amused by their translation of new trends and slang pop up among the young generation. Tbh, that's what motivates me to read and share these articles.

I hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I do.

## Business & Economy

* [China’s Top Brands Turn Cautious Over Economic Recovery](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-15/brands-grow-cautious-over-china-s-economic-recovery-with-divergence-in-spending#xj4y7vzkg) By Bloomberg News with Jinshan Hong, Daniela Wei, Charlotte Yang, Irene Huang, Shirley Zhao, and Yujing Liu [2023/08/16]
> “Spending behavior has changed, especially for the country’s younger population,” said Dickie Wong, director of research at Kingston Securities Ltd. “The country’s economic outlook is gloomy, many couldn’t find dream jobs after graduation, so why bother planning and saving to buy a house or a car? We see the trend of people more willing to spend on travel, go to hotpot, drink with friends and buy clothes — the sense that you only live once.”

* 🚀️ [China Is Acting More Like a Scrooge Than a Champion of Socialism](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-08-14/china-economy-why-won-t-the-party-spend-on-citizens) By Minxin Pei [2023/08/15]
> The ruling Chinese Communist Party wants everyone to know that it is building “socialism with Chinese characteristics.” But based on its proven reluctance to spend on the Chinese people, even in circumstances that warrant short-term direct cash subsidies to consumers, the party looks more like a scrooge than a champion of socialism.

* 🚀️ [Why Is China’s Economy Stumbling?](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/10/opinion/china-economy-decline.html) By PAUL KRUGMAN [2023/08/10]
> But you don’t have to study much history to be aware that autocratic regimes sometimes respond to domestic difficulties by trying to distract the population with foreign adventurism. I’m not saying that will happen. But realistically, China’s domestic problems make it more, not less, of a danger to global security.

* [Investors Visiting China Find Officials Fearful of Upsetting Xi](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-08/xi-speak-and-closed-doors-obscure-china-s-18-trillion-economy) By Lucille Liu, Rebecca Choong Wilkins, Richard Henderson, Jing Li, Yujing Liu, and Colum Murphy [2023/08/09]
> Accounts from more than a dozen people, some who asked not to be identified to speak freely, describe dinner invitations that were seen as potential ethics breaches and politely declined, silence around taboo topics such as deflation and bland party speak replacing the honest exchange of ideas. Once-familiar officials, they said, are now fearful of breaching newly broadened anti-espionage laws as President Xi Jinping grows more wary of the US and its allies.

* [How America is failing to break up with China](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/08/how-america-is-failing-to-break-up-with-china) By the Economist [2023/08/08]
> Ironically, then, the process driving America and China apart in trade and investment may actually be forging stronger financial and commercial connections between China and America’s allies.

* [Bankers Forced to Study Xi’s Thoughts as Party Tightens Grip](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-08/bankers-forced-to-study-xi-s-thoughts-as-party-tightens-grip) By John Liu [2023/08/08]
> Even employees at global firms including BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest fund manager, have been called in to attend lectures on the topic by regulators.The study sessions — viewed by some as time-consuming chores — underscore the growing role of ideology in China as Xi tries to increase the party’s influence over many aspects of local life, including a corporate sector that’s been chastened in recent years by a series of government crackdowns.

* [Bankers Chasing Deals in China Turn to ‘Throwing Eggs’ Card Game](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-06/bankers-chasing-deals-in-china-turn-to-throwing-eggs-card-game?srnd=asia-politics) By Alfred Cang and Chongjing Li [2023/08/07]
> The game is the latest way to tap into or improve one’s guanxi, a term that describes the sometimes exclusionary social circles, influence connections and relationships that help grease the wheels of commerce everywhere. As in other countries, guanxi can pave the way for business deals in China — as well as serve as a source of corruption.

* [The End of China’s Economic Miracle](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/end-china-economic-miracle-beijing-washington) By [Adam S. Posen](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/end-china-economic-miracle-beijing-washington#author-info)  [2023/08/02]
> Economic development in authoritarian regimes tends to follow a predictable pattern: a period of growth as the regime allows politically compliant businesses to thrive, fed by public largess. But once the regime has secured support, it begins to intervene in the economy in increasingly arbitrary ways. Eventually, in the face of uncertainty and fear, households and small businesses start to prefer holding cash to illiquid investment; as a result, growth persistently declines.

* [The Hunt for Best Bank Savings Rate in China May Require Trekking Hundreds of Miles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-06/china-savers-trek-hundreds-of-miles-for-higher-deposit-rates#xj4y7vzkg) By Bloomberg News With Allen K Wan, Amanda Wang, Zheng Li, and Qi Ding [2023/07/06]
> Meticulous planning, in-depth research and long-distance travel — welcome to the “special forces-style” hunt for the best bank deposit rates in China.

* [Can the World Make an Electric Car Battery Without China?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/16/business/china-ev-battery.html)
  By Agnes Chang [2023/05/16]
> It is one of the defining competitions of our age: The countries that can make batteries for electric cars will reap decades of economic and geopolitical advantages. Despite billions in Western investment, China is so far ahead — mining rare minerals, training engineers and building huge factories — that the rest of the world may take decades to catch up.

## Politics

* 🚀️ [Why You Should Worry About China’s Missing Minister](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/qin-gang-china-missing-foreign-minister/674954/) By Michael Schuman [2023/08/09]
> If the world’s best China experts can’t figure out what happened to one of the country’s most internationally recognizable officials, then imagine what else remains hidden behind the regime’s closed doors.

* [China Emphasizes Absent Xi Has Been ‘Strong’ in Flood Response](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/china-emphasizes-absent-xi-has-been-strong-in-flood-response) By John Liu [2023/08/08]
> On Sunday, the state-owned tabloid Global Times criticized the coverage of the flooding by Western media outlets, describing reporting on grievances held by people in Hebei as “hype” that is “trying to sow discord between Chinese people and the government.”

* [Xi Jinping’s revealing response to floods and heatwaves](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/04/xi-jinpings-revealing-response-to-floods-and-heatwaves) By The Economist [2023/08/04]
> Alas, the party seems allergic to freewheeling grassroots debate about whether the climate is changing. To date, most public discussion about China’s year of extreme weather has been strikingly inward-looking. State-media outlets have dwelled on heroics by soldiers, officials and rescue teams. Netizens have complained about instances of official incompetence. Social-media users have asked whether storm warnings were given in time, or whether floodwaters were diverted away from Beijing towards less privileged places.

* [Anger Builds in Towns Deliberately Flooded, in Part, to Save Beijing](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/world/asia/china-flood-beijing-rain.html?searchResultPosition=5) By [Keith Bradsher](https://www.nytimes.com/by/keith-bradsher) [2023/08/04]
> A provincial leader set off an outcry by urging cities to serve as a “moat” for the capital, as diverted floodwaters sent scores of residents fleeing.

* [Xi’s Spent Two Days Outside China in 2023 as Problems Mount](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-03/xi-jinping-isn-t-traveling-to-deal-with-china-s-economy-political-scandals) By John Liu and Jill Elaine Disis [2023/08/04]
> Two days is all President Xi Jinping has spent outside his country this year, as mounting domestic problems from a faltering economy to rare political scandals demand the Chinese leader’s attention at home.

* [China Official’s Call to Save Xi’s City. Angers Flood Victims.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-03/china-officials-call-to-save-xi-s-projects-angers-flood-victims#xj4y7vzkg) By John Liu, Jing Li, Colum Murphy, Zheng Wu, Jenni Marsh, and Charlie Zhu [2023/08/03]
> Chinese flood victims in hard hit areas of northern China have taken aim at a key Communist Party official, saying he sacrificed their safety to protect President Xi Jinping’s flagship projects.

* [Beijing can’t make North Korea ‘denuclearise’, Mr Blinken](https://www.scmp.com/comment/article/3228727/beijing-cant-make-north-korea-denuclearise-mr-blinken) By Alex Lo  [2023/07/24]
> Muammar Gaddafi died with a bayonet stuck out of his rear end. Saddam Hussein was almost completely decapitated when he was hanged because his executioners didn’t do, or didn’t know how to do, the basic but essential maths that works out the ratio between the length of the rope and the weight of the condemned. It’s true what your old teacher told you about maths being useful in all kinds of situations and professions. Besides the commonality of their gruesome deaths, they also had something else in common: both gave up their nuclear weapons programme.

## Culture & Society

* [Why Chinese women are denied legal land rights](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/10/why-chinese-women-are-denied-legal-land-rights) By the Economist [2023/08/10]
>The National People’s Congress is pondering changes to the law to improve the definition of village land rights and membership of rural collectives. Reformers see a chance to advance gender equality. Alas, appeasing majority opinion weighs heavily on officials whose greatest duty, arguably, is weiwen, or stability maintenance. The Communist Party came to power promising to emancipate women from feudalism. Now it co-opts ancestral clans and their patriarchal values. China’s rulers are obsessed with order, as an adjunct to power. And power is in the party’s blood.

* [The End of Optimism in China](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/06/-china-pessimism-economy-censorship/674556/)  By Michael Schuman [2023/06/29]
> An online post by the Communist Party Youth League and state broadcaster CCTV used the fate of Kong Yiji to scold the young and jobless as arrogant and lazy. Kong failed “because he couldn’t let go of the airs of a scholar and was unwilling to change his situation through labor,” the post lectured. Xi—who has said he opposes the “idleness-breeding trap of welfarism”—has told his nation’s struggling youth to learn to “eat bitterness.”

* [People in China are so worried about the economy they’re asking for divine intervention](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/09/economy/china-unemployment-temple-lottery-intl-hnk/index.html) By Laura He [2023/06/09]
> “No school-going, no hard-working, only incense-burning” has been a popular hashtag on social media since March, referring to a growing trend among young people in China who escape a pressure-cooker society by going to temples to pray for luck.

* [Inside the Barbecue City That Is China’s Hottest Tourist Destination](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/21/world/asia/zibo-barbecue.html) By Vivian Wang [2023/05/21]
> Inside this Coachella for barbecue, visitors could pose with a mascot dressed like a meat skewer. They could watch a concert against an LED backdrop of radiating flames. They could eat from one of the hundreds of grills scattered across the grounds the size of 12 football fields — if they waited hours for a table, and if their chosen meat purveyor hadn’t run out of food.

* [Hollywood is losing the battle for China](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2023/04/29/hollywood-is-losing-the-battle-for-china) By The Economist [2023/04/26]
> To Western viewers, such pro-government stories may seem crude (although the makers of “Born to Fly” could point out that “Top Gun” was produced with the blessing of America’s navy). But their popularity suggests that the Communist Party’s propaganda organs are making an impact. Increasingly, home-grown cinema is shaping how a generation of Chinese people view their country and its place in the world.

* [China’s Last Generation](https://www.noemamag.com/chinas-last-generation/) By Jacob Dreyer [2023/01/26]
> The pandemic woke China’s young people up to the reality that their society is oriented to the values and priorities of the elderly, whose truths are very different from their own.

## Stories of Individuals

* [Li Ziqi’s Online Pastoral Poetics](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/li-ziqis-online-pastoral-poetics) By Oscar Schwartz [2023/08/04]
> This was in 2016, a time when short-form online videos were becoming popular in China, and the so-called Wanghong economy—the influencer-to-online-commerce pipeline—was emerging as a major economic possibility for millennials. Young rural migrant workers, hoping to get noticed, made videos that exaggerated the consumptive excesses of city life. Li’s concept went in entirely the opposite direction, speaking to a growing subculture of those embracing Han neo-traditionalism as a solution to ever-westernizing Chinese cosmopolitanism.

* [The Art of Telling Forbidden Stories in China](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/03/magazine/chinese-literature-censorship.html) By Han Zhang [2023/08/03]
> After Hao submitted the manuscript to Hardie Grant Books, his Australian publisher, in spring 2021, his editors urged him to leave China out of concern for his safety. He equivocated. A few years in prison was a price he was willing to pay for the book’s publication.

* [‘If I left, I’d have to go without a word’: how I escaped China’s mass arrests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/01/my-escape-from-chinas-mass-arrests-uyghurs-xinjiang-reeducation-camps) By [Tahir Hamut Izgil](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tahir-hamut-izgil) [2023/08/01]
> Slowing down, I peered through my car window at the yard. About 100, or perhaps 200 Uyghurs stood there in silent uncertainty, while armed special police, clad in black, loaded them on to two buses parked in the courtyard. A few of the people boarding the buses looked longingly out of the yard. I felt a chill come over me. The mass arrests had reached Urumqi.

* [For North Koreans in China, Seeking Freedom Is More Perilous Than Ever](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/09/world/asia/north-korea-china-defectors.html) By Choe Sang-Hun  [2023/07/09]
> “I have been aiding North Koreans for 23 years,” Mr. Chun said. “I have never felt this sad and helpless.”“I have been aiding North Koreans for 23 years,” Mr. Chun said. “I have never felt this sad and helpless.”

* [‘Anti-American’ Chinese pundit faces backlash for attending Independence Day party at US Embassy in Beijing](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/06/china/china-simanan-us-embassy-independence-day-intl-hnk/index.html) By Nectar Gan [2023/07/07]
> “Sima Nan is not alone. He is the epitome of millions of Chinese who, after the policy of reform and opening up, adapted to an environment where profit-seeking has replaced faith. They talk about ideological doctrines but only care about doing business at heart.”

* [China Took Her Husband. She Was Left to Uncover His Secret Cause.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/world/asia/china-dissident-blog-program-think.html) By Vivian Wang [2023/07/05]
> He was brilliant, quirky and intensely private — and also, she now suspects, an anonymous dissident blogger who had won fame for years of evading the surveillance state.

## Funny and Weird Stories

* [Chinese Zoo Denies, in Voice of a Bear, That Sun Bear Is a Person in a Suit](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/01/world/asia/chinese-zoo-sun-bear-costume.html?searchResultPosition=16) By [Alan Yuhas](https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-yuhas) and [Chang Che](https://www.nytimes.com/by/chang-che) [2023/08/01]
> The statement insisted that the bear was truly a bear, as opposed to a person pretending to be a bear — or a person pretending to be a bear insisting they were not a person pretending to be a bear.
