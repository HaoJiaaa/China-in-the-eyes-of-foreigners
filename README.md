**If you can afford it, please support good journalism.**

I'm really impressed by how fast some journalists catch up with the latest trend on China's social media. I often get amused by their translation of new trends and slang pop up among the young generation. Tbh, that's what motivates me to read and share these articles.

I hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I do. 

Here we go~

>Alas, the party seems allergic to freewheeling grassroots debate about whether the climate is changing. To date, most public discussion about China’s year of extreme weather has been strikingly inward-looking. State-media outlets have dwelled on heroics by soldiers, officials and rescue teams. Netizens have complained about instances of official incompetence. Social-media users have asked whether storm warnings were given in time, or whether floodwaters were diverted away from Beijing towards less privileged places.

* [Li Ziqi’s Online Pastoral Poetics](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/li-ziqis-online-pastoral-poetics) By Oscar Schwartz [2023/08/04]

> This was in 2016, a time when short-form online videos were becoming popular in China, and the so-called Wanghong economy—the influencer-to-online-commerce pipeline—was emerging as a major economic possibility for millennials. Young rural migrant workers, hoping to get noticed, made videos that exaggerated the consumptive excesses of city life. Li’s concept went in entirely the opposite direction, speaking to a growing subculture of those embracing Han neo-traditionalism as a solution to ever-westernizing Chinese cosmopolitanism.

> A provincial leader set off an outcry by urging cities to serve as a “moat” for the capital, as diverted floodwaters sent scores of residents fleeing.

> The statement insisted that the bear was truly a bear, as opposed to a person pretending to be a bear — or a person pretending to be a bear insisting they were not a person pretending to be a bear.

> Muammar Gaddafi died with a bayonet stuck out of his rear end. Saddam Hussein was almost completely decapitated when he was hanged because his executioners didn’t do, or didn’t know how to do, the basic but essential maths that works out the ratio between the length of the rope and the weight of the condemned. It’s true what your old teacher told you about maths being useful in all kinds of situations and professions. Besides the commonality of their gruesome deaths, they also had something else in common: both gave up their nuclear weapons programme.

>   “Sima Nan is not alone. He is the epitome of millions of Chinese who, after the policy of reform and opening up, adapted to an environment where profit-seeking has replaced faith. They talk about ideological doctrines but only care about doing business at heart.”

  By Bloomberg News With Allen K Wan, Amanda Wang, Zheng Li, and Qi Ding [2023/07/06]

  By Laura He [2023/06/09]

> “No school-going, no hard-working, only incense-burning” has been a popular hashtag on social media since March, referring to a growing trend among young people in China who escape a pressure-cooker society by going to temples to pray for luck.

* [Inside the Barbecue City That Is China’s Hottest Tourist Destination](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/21/world/asia/zibo-barbecue.html)
  By Vivian Wang [2023/05/21]

> Inside this Coachella for barbecue, visitors could pose with a mascot dressed like a meat skewer. They could watch a concert against an LED backdrop of radiating flames. They could eat from one of the hundreds of grills scattered across the grounds the size of 12 football fields — if they waited hours for a table, and if their chosen meat purveyor hadn’t run out of food.

* [Can the World Make an Electric Car Battery Without China?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/16/business/china-ev-battery.html)
  By Agnes Chang [2023/05/16]

> It is one of the defining competitions of our age: The countries that can make batteries for electric cars will reap decades of economic and geopolitical advantages. Despite billions in Western investment, China is so far ahead — mining rare minerals, training engineers and building huge factories — that the rest of the world may take decades to catch up.

* [Hollywood is losing the battle for China](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2023/04/29/hollywood-is-losing-the-battle-for-china) By The Economist [2023/04/26]

> To Western viewers, such pro-government stories may seem crude (although the makers of “Born to Fly” could point out that “Top Gun” was produced with the blessing of America’s navy). But their popularity suggests that the Communist Party’s propaganda organs are making an impact. Increasingly, home-grown cinema is shaping how a generation of Chinese people view their country and its place in the world.
