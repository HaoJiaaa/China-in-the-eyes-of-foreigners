**If you can afford it, please support good journalism.**

I'm really impressed by how fast some journalists catch up with the latest trend on China's social media. I often get amused by their translation of new trends and slang pop up among the young generation. Tbh, that's what motivates me to read and share these articles.

I hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I do.

Saddam Hussein was almost completely decapitated when he was hanged because his executioners didn’t do, or didn’t know how to do, the basic but essential maths that works out the ratio between the length of the rope and the weight of the condemned. It’s true what your old teacher told you about maths being useful in all kinds of situations and professions. Besides the commonality of their gruesome deaths, they also had something else in common: both gave up their nuclear weapons programme.

>   “Sima Nan is not alone. He is the epitome of millions of Chinese who, after the policy of reform and opening up, adapted to an environment where profit-seeking has replaced faith. They talk about ideological doctrines but only care about doing business at heart.”

They could eat from one of the hundreds of grills scattered across the grounds the size of 12 football fields — if they waited hours for a table, and if their chosen meat purveyor hadn’t run out of food.

But their popularity suggests that the Communist Party’s propaganda organs are making an impact. Increasingly, home-grown cinema is shaping how a generation of Chinese people view their country and its place in the world.
